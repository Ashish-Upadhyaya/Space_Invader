# Space_Invader
This project is a basic implementation of the classic Space Invaders game using the Pygame library in Python. The player controls a spaceship, which moves left and right along the bottom of the screen using keyboard inputs. The spaceship can shoot bullets to destroy approaching alien enemies that move randomly across the screen.
